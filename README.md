# Overview 
### In my Microsoft project, I am working towards specific objectives that aim to drive strategic decision-making in the realm of original video creation. The primary focus is on utilizing data analysis techniques to gain a comprehensive understanding of the video content landscape and the complexities associated with the industry. By leveraging data, I aim to extract valuable insights that can inform our strategies in entering and thriving in the competitive world of original video creation. Through this project, I seek to identify the production infrastructure, budget efficiency, industry recognition and strategic partnerships. The ultimate goal is to develop a successful video content creation strategy that sets Microsoft apart in the market.
## Business Understanding 
### Microsoft's endeavor to enter the original video creation space presents a significant business challenge that requires a comprehensive understanding of the industry landscape. Through meticulous industry market analysis, the primary objective is to align our efforts with stakeholder goals, and capital improvement. To achieve this, I will conduct a thorough assessment of the competitive landscape to gain insights into how other industry players are performing. Furthermore, I will diligently analyze potential risks and develop robust mitigation strategies to safeguard Microsoft's interests in this new business venture. To solidify my approach, a comprehensive financial analysis will be conducted to assess the feasibility and potential return on investment. By quantifying the financial implications, benefits, and risks associated with the project, we will provide a solid foundation for decision-making and demonstrate the viability of our strategic endeavor.
## Stakeholder and Key Business Questions
### How to gain insights into how other industry players are performing?
### What are the benefits of industry recognition and the establishment of strategic partnerships?
### How production budgets are distributed?
## Data Understanding and Analysis 
### I will commence the analysis by examining the provided data sets encompassing industry players, industry recognition, strategic partnerships, and production budgets. My initial focus will be on ensuring the data's cleanliness, consistency, and suitability for analysis. Once prepared, I will proceed to calculate descriptive statistics for the pertinent variables and generate insightful visualizations based on the derived variables. Additionally, I will conduct extensive research on the benefits associated with industry recognition and the establishment of strategic partnerships. Incorporating this acquired knowledge, I will enrich my analysis and provide a comprehensive understanding of the advantages and impacts of industry recognition and strategic alliances. Furthermore, I will delve into the distribution of production budgets within the dataset, conducting a budget analysis. This will involve calculating summary statistics such as the mean, median, and standard deviation of the budgets and visualizing the budget distribution using histograms or box plots. Lastly, I will meticulously interpret the findings obtained through data exploration and analysis, extracting key insights and trends related to the performance of industry players, the benefits of industry recognition and strategic partnerships, as well as the distribution of production budgets. These insights will serve as the foundation for addressing the specific questions at hand and formulating actionable recommendations and strategies based on the available data.
